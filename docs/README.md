gokv documentation
==================

The basic usage is shown in the repository's root [README](../README.md).

Implementation-specific documentation can be found in the GoDoc of the subpackages. An overview of all subpackage GoDocs can be found on the GoDoc site of the main package: [https://www.godoc.org/github.com/philippgille/gokv#pkg-subdirectories](https://www.godoc.org/github.com/philippgille/gokv#pkg-subdirectories).

This documentation only contains documentation that's not as purely technical as the GoDoc, and not as exemplary as the repository's root README.
